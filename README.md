# NEA-Project
This is the code for my A-Level computer science NEA project. Please read the README file for more explanation.

The code may not run due to the specified path for audio files not being available on your computer. The code may also not run due to the specified path for the image files being available on your computer. 
To fix this ensure that the audio and image files are in the same folder as the program
Another issue that may not allow the code to run is if audio settings are blocked on your network.
